## STEP 1 : last User Stories
- The group sends their **last** feature Pull Request. No more US will be accept after this moment.
- Write a good REAME.md on your project to help other developers install and configure your project.
- Clean the database (migrations) if needed and check that your project is working.

## STEP 2 : test 
- Each group install the project of another group (using the README).

- Once the project you have to test is ready, check :
    - Every feature, every link works well
    - Graphic consistency
    - UX
    - Responsive design
    - Check main pages with W3C validator
    - Try every form and challenge security
    - Spelling mistakes
    - etc...
- For EVERY problem, open an issue on the project repository
    1. Go to "Issue" tab of tested project
    2. Create a new issue, with a clear name and concise explanation of how reproduce the bug (with kindness as always)
    3. add a "fix" label
    
## STEP 3 - Fix, fix, fix 
Each group works on its own project
- Read all the fix issues 
- Clean the issues (merge, delete if necessary). Pay attention to eliminate issues which are evolutions (new features) and not real bugs. Only focus and bugs to fix
- Prioritize the remaining issues
- Assign the issues as tasks to each member of the team, and add them to your sprint planning

Uou can automatically close current issues when you add the issue id to your commit message, e.g. "fix form validation, issue #12" will close the issue.

**Last Pull Requests will be accepted at the end of this step, no more PR will we accepted later. You are warned!**

## STEP 4 : Demo DAY training 
The team will prepare their presentation and rehearse, again and again, to be ready for the Demo at the end of the day. 
- 5 min max per project (everyone can speak ~1-2 min). Check with your instructor, as this may depend on the organization on your campus.
- if necessary, you can create some slides to quickly introduce the project 
- rehearse, rehearse, rehearse
- choose somebody to share its screen with a clean project (clean the database, the uploaded images...)
You will have to rehearse in front of your trainer(s).

Just before the Demo Day, a global rehearsal will be done with all groups.
